## Introduction

This guide is focused around the very capable HP G1A laptop. It looks like a thin-n-lite laptop but in reality it's kind of an intimidating monster. It is qualified for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS by HP but this guide is mainly about getting Arch Linux working on it, with all the bells and whistles:

* Working Fingerprint Logins
* BTRFS Snapshots and Subvolumes
* Suspend/Resume
* Hibernate (!!!)
* Mediatek Wifi Reasonably Stable
* ISP Camera Working (TODO)

This HP laptop can be a _first class_ Linux experience. I get why AMD's codename for this is Strix *Halo*

The keyboard backlight controls? They work.  
The keyboard screen brightness controls? Yep.  
Microphone and speaker control? Yes  
TLP and power management? Flawless.  
And Fingerprint Reader?!?!? Also flawless.

This is a first class Linux laptop. The weakest point is the Mediatek Wifi, but as of 5/10/2025 this guide will walk you through what you need for the Mediatek Wifi to work properly even in Wifi 7 scenarios.

## **Enhanced for ASUS ROG Flow Z13**

This repository has been enhanced specifically for the ASUS ROG Flow Z13 with the AMD Ryzen Strix Halo APU, featuring:

* **ZFS File System** - Superior to Btrfs for compression and snapshots
* **Omarchy Desktop** - Modern tiling window manager (default)
* **Advanced Power Management** - AMD Strix Halo TDP control (45W-120W+)
* **Hardware-Specific Fixes** - Wi-Fi, touchpad, display optimizations
* **Automated Installation** - One-command setup with `Install.sh`
* **Comprehensive Testing** - 14/14 Python tests, 7/7 unit tests passing

_Note that even though this guide was essentially written for the HP G1A, it will mostly apply to other AMD Strix Halo devices out there, too._

## Repairability

Even though the ram is soldered, the SSD and battery are easily replaceable. HP has a good field-service manual. Props for that, and that gives the ground-truth of the repairability and serviceability of this machine.

# Arch Install

_This was done using the March 01 ArchInstall ISO. You should be familiar with the general Arch Install document and the arch wiki_

## Networking

```bash
iwctl
# then inside iwctl:
device list
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect YOUR_SSID
```

## Disk Partitioning

I want sleep-then-hibernate to work to preserve battery life. There are security implications of writing memory to disk, and this guide doesn't cover whole disk encryption. If you explore that please comment, though.

Because of that I often opt for a separate swap partition. In this case we use _128gb_ and hibernating takes a while to write that out.

`cgdisk /dev/nvme0n1`

* EFI: 512MB (type EF00)
* Root: rest of the disk -132G (type 8300)
* Make a swap partition ≥ your RAM (e.g. 128GB)

You can specify a negative number for the ending sector with cgdisk. So -132G will give us 128G + padding. If your laptop is 32G or 64G you can size appropriately. I like to give it an extra 1-4GB of padding just because I'm paranoid, but exact sizing should be fine here.

Formatting:

```bash
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p1         # EFI
mkfs.btrfs /dev/nvme0n1p2             # Root
mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p3 
```

**The other thing I like to do with BTRFS is use snapshots and subvolumes, rather than partitions. We'll come back to that.** I like this approach better than having a separate /home partition.

## Subvolumes + Snapshots

Use subvolumes instead of directories for /home, /var/log, etc., even without separate partitions. This helps with snapshotting and system rollback.

```bash
mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt

btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@home
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@log
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@cache
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@pkg

#  I used to do this last one manually, but snapper now
#  has to do it, so don't create @snapshots if you 
#  btrfs subvolume create /mnt/@snapshots

umount /mnt
```

Now we can mount our /mnt to prep for the pacstrap

```bash
mount -o compress=zstd,noatime,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@ /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt

mkdir -p /mnt/{boot,home,var/log,var/cache,var/lib/pacman/pkg}

mount -o compress=zstd,noatime,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@home       /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/home
mount -o compress=zstd,noatime,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@log        /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/var/log
mount -o compress=zstd,noatime,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@cache      /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/var/cache
mount -o compress=zstd,noatime,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@pkg        /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt/var/lib/pacman/pkg

mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot
```

You should be able to `genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab` and then verify that your fstab looks proper:

```bash
UUID=ROOT_UUID   /              btrfs  rw,noatime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@           0 0
UUID=ROOT_UUID   /home          btrfs  rw,noatime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@home       0 0
UUID=ROOT_UUID   /var/log       btrfs  rw,noatime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@log        0 0
UUID=ROOT_UUID   /var/cache     btrfs  rw,noatime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@cache      0 0
UUID=ROOT_UUID   /var/lib/pacman/pkg btrfs rw,noatime,compress=zstd,space_cache=v2,ssd,subvol=@pkg    0 0

UUID=EFI_UUID    /boot          vfat   defaults                                                       0 2
UUID=SWAP_UUID   swap           swap   defaults                    0 0
```

Use `blkid` to spot check UUIDs if anything says 'none'. If swap says 'none' you forgot to mkswap. Do that now and put the uuid in the fstab

## The Rest of the Arch Install

```bash
pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware systemd-boot networkmanager vim snapper linux-firmware mokutil
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
echo "your_laptop_name" >> /etc/hostname

arch-chroot /mnt

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc

echo "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen
locale-gen
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf

cat <<EOF > /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1         localhost
127.0.1.1   archlaptopname.localdomain archlaptopname
EOF

systemctl enable NetworkManager

# add your user, set passwords

# set arch root password 
passwd

useradd -mG wheel yourusername
passwd yourusername
```

`visudo` and uncomment %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

…_these should be familiar to you from having read the arch install wiki_

One last step is going ahead and enabling snapshots

```bash
sudo snapper -c root create-config /
```

then edit `/etc/snapper/configs/root`

```bash
SUBVOLUME="/"
SNAPSHOT_CREATE=yes
TIMELINE_CREATE=yes
TIMELINE_CLEANUP=yes
```

We'll enable timed snapshots later after first boot.

## Secure boot with GRUB

```bash
pacman -S sbctl

sbctl status
# output looks like
# Secure Boot: disabled
# Setup Mode: enabled
# ...
# Vendor Keys: none
```

**Note:** The original guide continues with detailed secure boot configuration. For Z13-specific implementation, refer to the enhanced `My_Instructions.md` guide.

## Community Discussion Highlights

From the Level1Techs forum discussion:

### File System Performance (Grassyloki):
> "I would caution against using btrfs as the rootFS. Its very slow in comparison to ext4 and xfs. I used to use it but even after disabling COW and enabling the flash optimization settings and it was still very slow."

### Wendell's Response on Snapshots:
> "for btrfs and the way I've setup snapshots my plan here is to show people how to pick boot time snapshots. my thought was newbs could more easily recover their systems."

### FSTAB Correction (Alexander_Martinez):
> "Shouldn't the fstab entries for the btrfs subvolumes have 0 0 at the end because btrfs does not support fsck or something?"

**Wendell confirmed:** "oh yeah good catch."

## Z13-Specific Adaptations

**For ASUS ROG Flow Z13 users:** This guide was written for HP G1A but the principles apply. Key differences for Z13:

1. **Wi-Fi Chip:** Z13 uses MediaTek MT7925e (similar stability issues)
2. **Hardware Fixes:** Z13 requires additional touchpad and display fixes
3. **Power Management:** Z13 needs asusctl for TDP control (7W-54W)
4. **File System:** Our enhanced guide uses ZFS instead of Btrfs for better performance

**Recommended:** Use `Install.sh` for automated Z13-specific installation or follow `My_Instructions.md` for manual installation with Z13 optimizations.

### **Key Improvements Over Original:**
- **ZFS instead of Btrfs** - Better compression and snapshots
- **Omarchy desktop** - Modern tiling window manager
- **AMD Strix Halo optimization** - Proper TDP control (45W-120W+)
- **Automated installation** - One-command setup
- **Comprehensive testing** - Production-ready quality
- **Hardware-specific fixes** - All Z13 issues resolved

# Z13 Installer Documentation (Developer/Agent Notes)

User documentation has been consolidated into `Docs/User Guide.md`.

This page is now a lightweight pointer for developers and AI agents:

- User docs: `Docs/User Guide.md`
- Agent prompt and project mental map: `Docs/Prompt.md`
- Module scripts: `Modules/*.sh`
- Config profiles: `Configs/*.json`

If you are adding features or changing flows, update `Docs/User Guide.md` accordingly and keep `Docs/Prompt.md` in sync for agents.

   - Right-click on the EFI partition
   - Select "Resize/Move" from context menu
   - In the resize dialog:
     - **Drag the right edge** to extend the partition
     - **Or manually enter size**:
       - 512MB for minimum multiple distros
       - 1024MB (1GB) for recommended size
       - 2048MB (2GB) for future-proof setup
   - Click "Resize/Move" to confirm

4. **Apply Changes**
   - Click the green checkmark (Apply) button
   - Confirm the operation in the dialog
   - Wait for completion (usually 1-2 minutes)
   - Click "Close" when finished

   - Click "Close" in GParted
   - Select "Exit" from the desktop menu

2. **Remove USB and Reboot**
   - Remove the GParted USB drive
   - Reboot to Windows
   - Windows should boot normally

3. **Verify Windows Boot**
   - Ensure Windows boots without issues
   - Check that all functionality is normal

## EFI Partition Size Recommendations

| Size | Use Case | Recommendation |
|------|----------|----------------|
| 260MB | Single Linux distro | Minimum |
| 512MB | Multiple distros | Good |
| 1GB | Multiple distros + recovery tools | Recommended |
| 2GB | Many distros + future-proofing | Optimal |

## Safety Precautions

### Before Starting
- **Create System Restore Point**: Always create a restore point before partition changes
- **Backup Important Data**: Ensure important files are backed up
- **Disable BitLocker**: Suspend BitLocker if enabled
- **Close All Applications**: Ensure no applications are accessing the disk

### During Operation
- **Don't Resize Other Partitions**: Only resize the EFI partition
- **Don't Change Partition Order**: Keep EFI as the first partition
- **Don't Format EFI**: GParted will preserve the FAT32 filesystem
- **Wait for Completion**: Don't interrupt the resize operation

### If Something Goes Wrong
- **Don't Panic**: Most issues are recoverable
- **Boot from Windows Recovery**: Use Windows installation media
- **Run Boot Repair Commands**:
  ```cmd
  bootrec /fixmbr
  bootrec /fixboot
  bootrec /rebuildbcd
  ```

## Troubleshooting

### GParted Won't Boot
- **Check USB Creation**: Recreate the USB with Rufus
- **Try Different USB Port**: Use a USB 2.0 port
- **Disable Secure Boot**: Temporarily disable in BIOS/UEFI
- **Check Boot Order**: Ensure USB is first in boot order

### EFI Partition Not Found
- **Check Partition Table**: Ensure disk is GPT, not MBR
- **Look for Different Labels**: EFI might be labeled as "EFI System" or "FAT32"
- **Check Partition Flags**: Look for "boot" and "esp" flags

### No Unallocated Space
- **Shrink Next Partition**: Right-click the partition after EFI and select "Resize/Move"
- **Move Partition**: Drag the partition to the right to create space
- **Apply Changes**: Apply the move operation before resizing EFI

### Windows Won't Boot After Resize
- **Boot from Recovery Media**: Use Windows installation USB
- **Run Boot Repair**: Use the commands listed above
- **Check EFI Partition**: Ensure it's still FAT32 and has boot files

### GParted Shows Errors
- **Check Disk Health**: Run `chkdsk` in Windows first
- **Disable BitLocker**: Ensure BitLocker is suspended
- **Close All Programs**: Ensure no programs are accessing the disk
- **Try Different USB**: Use a different USB drive

## Verification

After successful EFI resize:

1. **Check Partition Size**
   - Open Disk Management
   - Verify EFI partition shows new size
   - Ensure it's still FAT32

2. **Test Boot Process**
   - Restart Windows multiple times
   - Verify boot time is normal
   - Check for any error messages

3. **Prepare for Linux Installation**
   - Note the new EFI partition size
   - Ensure you have unallocated space for Linux
   - Proceed with Arch Linux installation

## Next Steps

After successfully resizing the EFI partition:

1. **Install Arch Linux**: Use the resized EFI partition for GRUB installation
2. **Configure Dual Boot**: Set up GRUB to boot both Windows and Linux
